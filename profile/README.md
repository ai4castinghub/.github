The [AI4Casting Hub](https://4castinghub.uoguelph.ca/) is a collaborative effort at the University of Guelph, in partnership with [N.S.E.R.C.](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp), [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com/en), 
[Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/) and [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/). 
Inspired by international initiatives like the CDC FluSight Hospitalization, European Covid-19 Forecast Hub, the AI4Casting Hub brings together Canadian researchers to improve the understanding and predictability of respiratory illnesses across Canada, focusing on COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

[AI4Casting Hub](https://4castinghub.uoguelph.ca/) forecasts are based on available surveillance data and reflect reported cases, which may not capture the full extent of disease activity. Due to variability in surveillance systems and data sources across Canadian regions, we advise focusing on trends rather than exact numbers for an accurate assessment of epidemiological patterns. Forecast reliability may vary based on factors such as model diversity and reporting delays. As with all forecasts, predictions come with inherent uncertainty, and past performance may not predict future accuracy.
